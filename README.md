# Requirements
Python3
cmake 2.8 or higher

# TODO
- Linux / make support
- Decide on highgui module / win32ui / gtk3: visual_debugging flag?
- Machine Learning Library
- Issue: Tests and Executables might not be named similar, otherwise collisions in binary output folder. maybe add "test_prefix" to tests?
